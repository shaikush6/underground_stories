# Huff & Heal
*Dark Eco-Comedy / Woodland Noir*

**Logline:** A misunderstood wolf-therapist must expose a poaching cartel run by Granny without breaking patient confidentiality or triggering a forest-wide relapse.

============================================================

A panicked thump. The stag lurched sideways, hooves carving wet furrows in the moss. The therapy circle shattered for a heartbeat—rabbits pressed back into bracken, wings snapped taut, a dozen prey eyes fixed on the lone wolf at their center.

Dr. Lupus Grimm did not flinch. Instead, he folded himself smaller, haunches sinking until his shoulders brushed the earth. His voice, low and steady, threaded through the hush. “Let’s draw the fear in, friends. Hold it. Now—” He inhaled, slow and deliberate, ribcage swelling as if to menace, then released a gentle, shuddering huff. The sound was not a growl, but the wind through hollow logs.

No one moved. Leaves twitched. Grimm’s yellow eyes flickered over the circle: a trembling rabbit gnawing the air, an old jay glaring with one unblinking orb, the stag’s sides heaving against the memory of pursuit.

Grimm’s own breath caught—he remembered the copper tang of ancient mistakes, the way his species’ hunger had once scattered this very clearing. He forced the memory down, exhaling pine and apology.

He met the rabbit’s gaze. “I know what my breath meant. But today, it means safety. Try with me. Just once.”

The rabbit’s paws shook as it mimicked him—shallow at first, then deeper, a ragged mirror. One by one, others followed: a hush of lungs, a tentative unity, the forest seeming to hold its own breath.

A branch snapped in the shadows. The stag jerked again, eyes wild. Grimm’s hackles prickled, a flash of fang threatening to betray him. He pressed his teeth shut, blood from a barely-healed cut flavoring his tongue—reminder and warning both.

“We all remember the old stories,” he said, softer now. “But we can write new endings. Breathe with me. Through it.”

A jay muttered, “Easy for you, wolf.” Silence. Then, a deer—smaller than the rest—stepped forward, nostrils quivering. It inhaled, held, and exhaled, the mist of its breath mingling with Grimm’s in the cold air.

For a moment, prey and predator shared the same rhythm. Grimm felt something loosen in his chest—not absolution, but possibility.

A drone’s whine sliced the calm, distant but unmistakable. The animals stiffened, panic threatening to retake the circle. Grimm’s eyes never left the treetops. “Stay with me,” he whispered, his voice a shield against the metal intruder.

But even as the group clung to their fragile trust, Grimm knew: the forest’s peace was provisional, and Granny’s eyes were never far.

Next session, he’d have to choose—oath or justice. And this time, the cost would not be his alone.

A hush, bruised and violet, pressed against the roots as the deer froze at the tree line—ears cocked, breath shallow. He’d tracked the old sooty trail—a crescent of black ash threading through wild thyme and moss—hoping for sanctuary, or at least a reprieve from the memory of snapping wire and hot, red pain.

Instead, he saw her: Red, boots muddied, cloak stark as a wound against the gloom, staggering beneath a canvas bundle that dripped—slow, deliberate—onto the birch-white snow.

The deer shrank back, nostrils flaring at the metallic tang. Above, a drone’s red eye blinked through the canopy, whirring its warning. Shadows flickered as Red approached the cottage—Granny’s den, its chimney coughing a thin, wolf-shaped plume into the sky.

Granny waited in the doorway, shawl drawn tight, her smile a cracked teacup. “You’re late,” she hissed, voice syrupy, hand reaching for the bundle.

Red’s jaw twitched. She glanced over her shoulder, gaze snagging on the trembling deer half-concealed in the bracken. Her hands shook as she hefted the pelts—slick, ruddy things that left her palms stained and raw. She tried not to look at them. She tried not to look at him.

“They were…easy to track,” Red managed, voice so thin it nearly vanished. The lie hung in the air, sticky as the blood crusting her knuckles.

Granny’s grip was iron. “You’ve done what was asked. The forest will thank you, in its own time.”

A thud as the pelts hit the threshold. The deer flinched. For an instant, the bundle seemed to twitch—as if muscle memory rebelled, as if the woods themselves refused to forget.

Red’s gaze flickered back to the deer, apology and terror tangled in her eyes. Her mouth opened, then closed. The drone dipped lower, casting a spinning shadow over them all.

The deer’s hooves locked to the earth. Run, some buried instinct screamed. But he could not—he could only bear witness, wide-eyed, as Red’s hands bled innocence onto Granny’s doorstep. He saw his own trembling reflected in her, saw the line between victim and accomplice blur and break.

Inside the cottage, the door swung shut with a muffled click. Smoke spiraled higher, blackening the sky. The deer’s heart hammered—he was no longer prey, but witness to a new kind of hunt.

From the darkness, a low huffing—gentle, steady—rose from somewhere unseen, threading through the trees. Dr. Grimm, drawing breath for a reckoning yet to come.

The forest held its breath, waiting for someone to break the silence.

A sharp rattle at the skylight—metal claws on glass. Dr. Grimm’s paw froze above his ledger. Another drone. Its red sensor blinked through the canopy like a baleful eye, sweeping the clinic’s mossy roof for the scent of betrayal. He forced his breath into a measured “huff,” fogging the page, but his pulse battered his ribs.

He shut the window with a snap that startled even himself. The forest hush deepened, roots and branches pressed closer to the walls, as if eavesdropping. Grimm hunched over his desk, the air thick with sap and the faint tang of ozone—the drone’s exhaust threading through pine and patchouli. He pressed the recorder’s stop button with a claw too blunt for violence, too stained for innocence.

The case files sprawled before him: anonymized, sanitized, but still bleeding. A red elastic band cinched one folder—Red’s, though he couldn’t write her name. Patient 27: recurring dreams of fur-lined traps, whispered threats, drones dropping pellets that left saplings curling and black in the morning. He cross-referenced her account with the others—Patient 14, Patient 32—each nightmare a map, pinning Granny’s poison to the forest’s veins.

Outside, the wind shifted. The oaks pressed their barky brows against the glass, shadows writhing with the promise of vengeance. Grimm felt them—spirits gathering, their breath a cold draft in the warm lamplight. If he broke his oath, their fury might be loosed upon the living. If he kept it, the forest would rot from the roots up.

His paw hovered over a line in Red’s transcript: “They said if I told, the wolves would come for me.” His own reflection stared back from the blacked-out window—yellow eyes, too wide for comfort. What big eyes you have, Doctor.

He uncapped his pen, but the weight of his code pressed his shoulders. One blackout stroke—just one—over a damning location. His pulse clicked in his ears like drone rotors. If he sent this, the activists would know enough to strike, but not enough to betray Red’s trust outright.

He hesitated. The drone outside bucked—downed by a gust or something angrier. Pellet dust scattered, silver as communion ash, across the sill.

Grimm wiped his brow, breathing in the mingled scent of pine, ozone, and fear. He sealed the altered file in a hollow log for pickup, feeling the forest’s eyes—hungry, hopeful, vengeful—watching.

Behind him, a sapling’s shadow twisted, whispering in a voice like splintered bone: “Choose, wolf. The path vanishes.”

He turned, heart hammering, as the first furious spirit pressed its face to the glass.

Moonlight combed the clearing, silvering scars and twitching whiskers. Dr. Lupus Grimm stood among his patients—no, his allies—fur bristling beneath his coat, claws flexing in the moss. The sanctuary’s hush was brittle, every breath a secret on the verge of shattering.

“Tonight,” he whispered, voice catching in the hush, “we end this.”

A dozen animals—staggered deer, a limping fox, the badger with half an ear—moved at his cue. Each wore a battered earpiece, stolen from Granny’s supply runs; the stag’s antlers glimmered with a red scrap of cloth, a mock-hood. Grimm’s trembling paw hovered over his phone. The livestream app glowed, red LED winking like an accusation.

He hesitated. Therapist, healer, wolf—every oath weighted his bones. He heard the drone’s whir—Granny’s eye. Too late for retreat.

Grimm pressed “GO LIVE.”

The forest erupted. Hooves thundered. Fur flashed. He led them down the root-choked path, moonlight flickering between branches, the taste of iron and ozone sharp on his tongue. The earth vibrated with the charge of old, buried rage.

They breached the pit’s hatch—a steel maw disguised as rotted log. Grimm’s breath slowed, huffing steady: “In, now. Remember the cages. Show them the hinges have rusted.”

Below, the stench of blood and oil. Caged animals shrank from the sudden light. Handlers—shadowed men and women—raised prods, eyes wide at the onrushing herd. The badger, once crippled, lunged—jaws finding flesh. Screams echoed, half-human, half-beast.

Through the lens, the world watched. Grimm’s voice, raw and shaking, filled the feed: “This is Granny’s mercy. Witness.”

A handler tried to run—tripped by a root that shouldn’t have been there. The forest, complicit. Drones swooped, their beams slicing chaos; a fox leapt, jaws snapping wires. Pain and liberation, knotted and inseparable, filled the pit.

Above it all: Granny’s voice, tinny through the speakers. “Doctor, your voice is soothing even while you slit throats.”

Grimm met the camera’s gaze. “You taught Red to fear the wolf. But what should she fear in you?”

The feed buffered, then froze—Grimm’s face caught between snarl and plea, moonlight carving his silhouette. In the silence, the forest held its breath. Something ancient was waking.

—End Scene—

Sirens fractured the dawn—red and blue strobing through the ancient green as eco-agents surged from the tree line, boots crushing moss, rifles leveled. The sanctuary’s hush collapsed, birds scattering in a ragged hush. Dr. Grimm’s hackles prickled as the first drone dipped, floodlight swinging across the blood-matted pit and Granny’s splintered compound.

Red froze mid-step, wicker basket clutched tight, sap-sticky hands trembling. “On your knees!” barked a voice behind riot glass. She dropped, knees digging into mud, eyes wide and wild—half prey, half witness. Grimm lunged, instinct pulling him between Red and the agents, arms raised. “She’s only a child—” He caught the muzzle of a rifle to his chest, breath knocked from his lungs. “Back, wolf,” spat a young agent, suspicion sour in her voice.

Across the yard, Granny’s hounds circled her—muscle and matted fur, eyes gleaming with something older than obedience. Granny, defiant to the last, jutted her chin. “Heel!” Her voice cracked, brittle as old bone. The hounds paused—then one snarled, lips peeling. Another joined, low and guttural, a sound that belonged to older woods, older wrongs.

The agents didn’t see it coming. They were too busy zip-tying Red’s wrists, reciting charges she barely heard. “Aiding and abetting… material witness… viral evidence…” Their jargon dulled the forest’s edge, but the hounds were unmoved by law.

Granny stumbled, cane clattering. “You useless mongrels, obey me!” she shrieked. The closest hound lunged. Teeth flashed, blood spattered her gingham apron. She vanished beneath the pack’s fury—her scream muffled by fur and snapping jaws. The agents spun, too late, guns rising, but nature had already claimed its due.

Dr. Grimm’s chest heaved—he fought the urge to run to her, to anyone. Instead, he knelt beside Red, voice low, breath slow and deliberate. “Huff with me,” he whispered, even as the air soured with iron and fear. “You’re not alone. You’re not her shadow.”

Red’s eyes brimmed, but she nodded, matching his breath. All around, the forest shuddered in the aftermath—roots cracking pavement, leaves trembling as if the woods themselves had exhaled.

A sergeant barked orders. “Secure the girl—bring the wolf in for questioning.” Drones hovered, cameras whirring, their digital gaze cold and unblinking. Somewhere deeper in the trees, something ancient stirred, unsatisfied.

The cordon tightened. Grimm met Red’s gaze as they were led away—her cloak, once bright, now streaked with blood and mud. Overhead, the sirens faded, and the forest waited, holding its breath for what would come next.

A glass atrium fractured sunlight into fangs across the conference table, where Dr. Grimm’s paw hovered, pen trembling, above the freshly printed Creed. Beyond the walls, the forest pressed in—lush, watchful, its canopy stitched with the distant drone of machines and the sharper cries of displaced jays.

A stag burst into the room, hooves scattering leaflets. “There’s a fight on the western trail—otter and hawk, over the new boardwalk.” His flanks shivered, nostrils wide with the scent of antiseptic and sap.

Grimm rose, chest tight, the Creed’s words—“First, do no harm—to the ecosystem”—hot in his mind. He glanced at Red, standing in the doorway with her courier satchel slung low, green cloak stained at the hem. Her eyes were wary, older than the woods.

He found the otter and hawk already locked in accusation, voices sharp. “You widened the riverbank,” the hawk spat, “and now my nest is exposed!”  
The otter flashed teeth. “Your drones spooked my kits—one vanished downstream!”

The world watched now; cameras blinked in the trees, global guests whispered in twenty tongues. Grimm inhaled, slow and deep—the huff breathing that calmed prey and predator alike. “This sanctuary is not a prize,” he said, voice steady, “nor a shield for old wounds. If we widen one path, we trample another. If we heal one, we risk harm elsewhere. This is the cost of care.”

The otter’s tail lashed. The hawk shook, wings trembling. Red stepped forward, voice low. “Trust must be earned. Even from those with teeth.”

Outside, a gust scattered the Creed drafts across the moss. Grimm bent to gather them, his claws catching on the page that bore Granny’s redacted case—a shadow beneath new law. He hesitated. If he included her story, he risked breaching his oath. Omit it, and the world might forget how close the forest had come to burning.

He looked at Red. “Will you co-sign?”  
She met his gaze. “If you’ll stand by it, when the forest roars.”

He pressed pen to paper, spine prickling as wind rattled the glass. The forest watched, silent and hungry, as the Creed became law.

A sudden shout from outside—a sapling split, tourists scattering, crows rising in a black tide. Grimm’s heart hammered. The land itself seemed to lurch, as if testing the promise he’d just made.

He turned to Red, jaw tight. “It’s begun.”
