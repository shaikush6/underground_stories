# Blowback
*Gentrification Satire / Viral-Media Farce*

**Logline:** A community-organizer wolf mounts escalating viral “huff-and-puff” protests against three tech-bro pigs building luxury smart-homes on ancestral forest.

============================================================

Fenrir “Wolf” Grey slammed open the straw-hinged door, scattering daylight across the makeshift foyer and drawing every gaze. “All right, friends—gather close,” he called, voice pitched to slice through the nervous chatter. His hand swept the rough straw wall, index finger tracing the scars of last winter’s repairs, a gesture part caress, part dare. Behind him, the tour group shuffled in, eyes wide: students with notepads, an elder with a thermos of dandelion tea, a corporate liaison in logoed windbreaker, already broadcasting live.

A child’s laugh ricocheted off clay-plastered bales. Fenrir grinned, but his jaw twitched—he caught the metallic whine of a drone circling outside. “This center—every inch—was built from the ground up by folks who actually live here,” he said, voice rising. “Straw, clay, sweat, and no blueprints but memory.”

A volunteer—Anya, cheeks smudged with dust—glanced at Fenrir, then at the corporate rep filming everything. “Should we show them the compost toilets, Fen?” she murmured. Her eyes flicked to the back room, where a wall patch sagged from last week’s rain. Fenrir’s stomach clenched. He shot a look at the rep, then at the elder—whose lips pressed into a line.

He made the call. “Of course. We’re not hiding anything.” His words tasted of risk.

As the group pressed deeper, the straw walls exhaled warmth, sunlight pooling gold on the floor. Fenrir’s hand found a brittle stalk poking from a seam—he snapped it off, fidgeted. “You know, people say straw’s flimsy. But this place has weathered storms, blackouts, and three zoning reviews.” The corporate rep smirked, thumbed a phone. “Solidarity’s not a hashtag,” Fenrir shot, “it’s what keeps the roof up when the wind’s howling.”

A sudden, muffled thud: a child—clumsy, curious—had punched through a soft spot in the wall, sunlight knifing in. The group froze. Fenrir’s heart hammered—he felt the old rage, the urge to lash out, to huff and puff and blow down every sterile condo rising at the woods’ edge. Instead, he crouched by the breach, voice steady. “See? Nothing to hide. We patch what breaks. Together.”

Outside, the drone hummed lower, lens glinting. The elder touched Fenrir’s shoulder, whispering, “The rezoning vote’s next week.” Fenrir straightened, facing the group—his pack and his audience, all at once.

“Let’s see the mural,” he said, leading them forward—toward a wall where native grasses, roots and all, sprawled in riotous color. Behind them, a cold wind slipped through the gap. Ahead, the laughter faltered, waiting.

Outside, the sound of jackhammers drew closer.

A drone’s whine sliced the hush—the first warning. Fenrir crouched in the shadow of the last wild oak, his phone hot in his palm. Across the churned soil, the pigs’ launch stage blazed: glass and brick, draped with LED banners that pulsed “Immutable. Sustainable. Forever.” Cameras tracked every gesture as the lead pig—Max, blazer popping at the seams—stepped into the light, grinning.

“Today, we build indestructible community,” Max declared, voice syrupy with PR. “Tokenized ownership for all!” Drones drifted overhead, their red eyes flickering over a crowd herded behind velvet ropes. The forest behind them recoiled, shadows stretched thin as bone.

Fenrir’s heart hammered. His followers waited—he could almost feel them, an invisible pack. He’d spent the night rigging the old oak with a projector, chaining himself to the roots, prepping the stream. The pigs’ launch was spectacle, but so was his defiance. He pressed “go live.”

A kaleidoscope of images splashed across the half-built model condo: children’s birthday parties under these trees, murals painted on bark, elders planting saplings before the tech-bros learned to code. Fenrir’s voice—steady, raw—cut through the digital applause. “They’ll call this progress. But who gets left outside when the doors lock tight?”

Onstage, Max’s smile twitched. A junior pig—slick hair, nervous hands—muttered, “There’s your wolf,” as security’s radios crackled. The cameras pivoted: Fenrir—chained, defiant, spectral images warring with LED ads. The crowd murmured, uncertain: was this part of the show?

Max forced a laugh. “We welcome all voices. Even those who, ah, huff and puff.” The PR team’s eyes flashed panic. Fenrir tasted his next move—he could detonate the stunt, unleash thirty seconds of pre-edited leaks: eviction letters, soil test coverups, a pig’s private doubts caught on mic. Viral wildfire. But spectacle was a trap. Would outrage topple the fortress, or just harden it?

He hesitated, a beat too long, fingers trembling over the “post” button. The oak creaked beneath him, ancient and alive. The wind picked up, scattering leaflets—his manifesto—into the crowd. Onscreen, a pigweed poked through the pristine pavement, ignored by all but the camera’s accidental gaze.

Security advanced. Fenrir’s stream spiked—comments, shares, the world’s gaze. He met Max’s eyes, saw the crack behind the glassy confidence. He chose restraint. For now.

“We’re still here,” Fenrir called, his voice a challenge and a promise. “Let’s see how well a QR code breathes when the forest exhales.”

The wind rose—a sudden, wild gust. The LED banners fluttered. The screen glitched.

And in the hush that followed, the crowd turned—not to the stage, but to the tree.

Scene 3: Security moves in, but Fenrir’s protest has already gone viral, and unexpected allies begin to emerge from the crowd…

REVISION:

A siren slices the dusk. Fenrir’s breath fogs in the cold as he sprints toward the bulldozer, boots slipping on slick steel. Behind him, protesters surge, their chant jagged and raw: “OUR WOODS, NOT YOUR WALLET!” The half-built EcoLoft towers loom, glass and scaffolding glinting in the drone’s LED glare.

He scrambles atop the bulldozer, heart pounding. Around his neck, his grandmother’s compass swings wild—an anchor in the chaos. The drone—hacked, crowd-funded, barely legal—dips low and unfurls a banner:  
**#HUFFANDPUFF**  
The tag flutters, mocking the showroom’s pristine windows. Phones rise, fingers swipe, the spectacle multiplying—each camera a promise, each tweet a threat.

A security guard bellows, “Get down!” Fenrir ignores him. He grabs the bullhorn, voice hoarse but fierce:  
“They want to wall us out, to sell the air itself. But wind finds every crack—”  
The drone’s rotor drowns him out. In the mirrored showroom, the CFO—pig-eyed, impassive—watches, lips curled in a smile that never reaches his eyes.

Fenrir’s phone vibrates:  
**CITY COUNCIL: Injunction filed. $5,000 fine. Cease & Desist.**  
He stares. Another penalty. The GoFundMe is already empty. Every viral win just stacks another brick against him.

A friend grabs his arm. “Fen, cops—now.”  
He hesitates. The crowd’s chant swells, a living force. If he runs, the spectacle dies. If he stays, the cause might. He glances at the drone—its camera red, unblinking. The banner rips loose, spinning into the trees.

Decision. Fenrir drops the bullhorn, leaps down. His ankle twists—pain sharp, immediate. He staggers, nearly laughs. “Scatter!” he shouts. The crew bolts as blue lights slice through the trees, sirens turning the oaks into bars.

The bulldozer’s engine coughs awake—someone inside, ready to erase the day’s defiance. Fenrir limps, adrenaline burning, as the crowd fractures—some fleeing, some filming, some linking arms in last-ditch defiance.

He ducks behind a toppled trunk, sap sticky on his hands. The drone hovers overhead, streaming everything. Another alert:  
**#HuffAndPuff trending. 120k views.**  
He closes his eyes, willing the air to stay wild.

A voice crackles in his earpiece: “Warehouse—security inside. They’re trashing everything. Fen, what do we do?”  
He freezes. The woods hold their breath.

He could hide, save himself. Or he could run—risk arrest, risk everything—to defend what’s left. The cost is real now: not just fines and hashtags, but smashed seedlings, broken spirits. The spectacle has teeth.

Fenrir wipes sap from his palm, jaw set. “Hold the feed. I’m coming.”  
He pushes off the trunk, limps toward the warehouse—toward sirens, glass, and the next breaking point. Behind him, the wind rises, banners tangled in branches, resistance and ruin caught in the crosscurrent.

Fenrir’s thumb hovers over the trigger. No warning. No warmup.

The clearing seethes with tension—drone cameras buzzing, pig-branded banners snapping, a crowd of onlookers pressed between ancient trunks and mirrored prefab facades. Fenrir stands atop a mossy stump, the sound-cannon cradled against his ribs. Its wooden barrel, lacquered and gleaming, looks both mythic and home-built; its digital readout glows sickly pink. Livestream viewership—thousands, then tens of thousands—tick upward on Fenrir’s phone, clutched in his trembling left hand.

He glances once at the condos: sun glaring off eco-glass, banners boasting “Built to Last,” the edge of construction fencing festooned with fake wildflowers. Behind the glass, the pigs—their CEO in a silk suit, PR staff clutching earpieces—watch, lips pursed, confident in their blockchain-bricked fortress. Fenrir’s voice cuts through the hush, pitched for the camera:

“You build on stolen earth. You sell green dreams with hollow bones. Let’s test what your ‘progress’ can weather.”

He inhales, lungs aching. Every eye—digital and human—fixes on him. A child’s voice somewhere: “Is he really gonna—?”

One squeeze.

The cannon’s low-frequency howl ripples outward, more felt in bone than heard in ear—ancient, jaw-deep, rolling through the undergrowth and the neural mesh of sensors alike. Birds scatter. The glass trembles; the condos’ walls shudder, seams spiderwebbing with pale, fractal cracks. For a moment, nothing falls—the world holds its breath.

Then: collapse. The nearest condo folds in on itself, bamboo beams snapping, algae-bricks tumbling in green dust. Banners flutter down atop the wreckage, “Built to Last” wilting in the haze. The crowd’s gasp, the digital feed’s burst of emojis—laughter, outrage, shock—collide in the clearing.

Fenrir stares, heart hammering. He wants to shout triumph, but his first instinct is to search for movement—anyone trapped, any wounded. Sirens wail in the distance. The pigs, faces blanched, are already speaking to their feeds, spinning the narrative: “Eco-terrorist attack—dangerous wolf—this is why we need stronger walls.”

Fenrir looks to the trees, mouth dry. “Am I the storm, or just the excuse for stronger walls?” he mutters, unheard beneath the settling dust.

Police lights flicker through the haze, blue and red strobing across fallen banners and ancient trunks. Fenrir shoulders the sound-cannon, eyes fixed on the approaching line. The livestream’s comment section explodes: “Run, Wolf. Run.”

He hesitates, pulse wild, caught between fight and flight—between legend and liability—as the wolves and pigs of old stories circle for the next move.

A snap of cameras. A ripple of static from a dozen lapel mics. The pigs—once ringed by handlers, influencers, and sleek-suited investors—stand marooned atop the unfinished steps of GreenBrick™ Residences, their “Sustainability Now!” banners drooping in the wind like sodden straw. Fenrir “Wolf” Grey watches from the shadow of an ancient oak, the crowd’s energy shifting, restless, hungry for a verdict.

A phone rings: sharp, merciless. The largest pig—CEO Sow, her pearls askew—fumbles with her earpiece, nodding, sweating under the glare of drones overhead. “We’re still—” she pleads, voice cracking into the void, “—committed to environmental—” But the words are lost as a hedge fund rep, face tight as rebar, steps away, signaling to the others. The media scrum parts; one by one, sponsors and partners peel off, leaving only a dwindling cluster of PR interns clutching branded tote bags.

The crowd is not kind. A chant begins—soft at first, then swelling, not quite jeering, but with an edge that cuts. “Whose woods? Our woods.” Fenrir feels it in his chest, an ache that is both vindication and warning.

He steps forward. The cameras swing to catch him, the “eco-activist” now framed as savior. Someone thrusts a microphone at his mouth. “Fenrir, what do you say to the collapse of GreenBrick? Will you take credit?”

He tastes the moment’s bitterness—victory as spectacle, the temptation to gloat. He remembers the wolf’s old hunger, the story they want him to fulfill. Instead, he shakes his head.

“This isn’t about me,” he says, voice low but steady. “It’s about what we build. Together.”

Behind him, a child tugs at his sleeve, offering a fistful of wildflowers—violets and clover torn from the forest’s edge. Fenrir kneels, takes them gently, then crosses to the construction site’s churned soil. In full view, he kneels and presses the flowers into the mud where the first condo foundation was poured.

The pigs—now mud-splattered, red-eyed—shuffle past the cameras, their “Sustainability Ambassador” sashes trailing in the dirt. CEO Sow tries to salvage dignity, mumbling about “further dialogue” and “app-based reforestation,” but the press has already turned away.

A hush settles. The wind rattles loose scaffolding; somewhere, a robin begins to sing.

Fenrir stands, hands stained with earth, and faces the crowd. His followers surge forward, but he holds up a hand—wait. The silence is thick, expectant. Everyone looks to him—not the villain, not the outsider, but the one left standing when the storm has passed.

He glances toward the forest, where sunlight flickers on the moss and the half-built towers cast jagged shadows. The battle is won, but the war—he knows with a pulse of dread and hope—has only changed shape.

From the treeline, a drone hovers, its red eye blinking. Watching. Recording. Waiting.

Scene end.

Chainsaws snarled behind the police tape—then died, mid-roar, as the news broke: the deed was done. Literally. Fenrir “Wolf” Grey stood in the churned mud, hands trembling around a battered clipboard, the notary’s seal still warm on his thumb. The pigs’ last-ditch legal team, stuffed into neon vests, hovered at the edge of the clearing, their PR smiles sagging as the press snapped photos of the new trust sign hammered to an ancient oak: COMMUNITY WOODLAND—PROTECTED IN PERPETUITY.

A cheer erupted, ragged but defiant. Fenrir felt it in his chest, a pulse as old as the roots beneath his boots. Still, his pulse stuttered. Victory was an unfamiliar animal—was it safe to touch?

He pressed his palm to a wall of golden straw, rough and warm beneath his callused hand. Volunteers—grandmothers, ex-foremen, even a couple of shell-shocked junior execs—hoisted bales into place, laughter cutting through the humidity. The youngest pig, pink as shame, stood awkwardly by a pile of salvaged lumber, eyes darting between his brothers and Fenrir.

“Want in?” Fenrir called, voice gruff with exhaustion. “Or you just here for the photo op?”

A beat of silence. The pig stepped forward, cheeks mottled. “I never wanted condos. I just…” He swallowed. “Can I help?”

Fenrir’s jaw flexed. The old rage flickered. He remembered the eviction notices, the hashtags dismissed as noise, the condescension in every “Why don’t you get a real job?” He could say no. But the wall needed another set of hands.

“Grab that end,” he said, nodding at the bale. “Straw’s only weak when it stands alone.”

As they lifted together, Fenrir felt the tremor in his own arms—relief, maybe, or the weight of finally belonging. A drone buzzed overhead, livestreaming the scene. Fenrir caught his reflection in a smartphone screen, mud-splattered, unguarded. For a moment, he raised his fist for the camera, habit’s old reflex. Then, quietly, he let it fall.

From the woods, the wind picked up, rattling the leaves—no longer a threat, but a hush, a benediction. The sun caught in the straw, turning it gold.

Behind him, the notary coughed, papers in hand. “There’s one more signature needed,” she said, eyes flicking to the crowd—and to the youngest pig, still clutching the trust deed. Fenrir’s heart hammered. The future hung, taut as a wire, on whether the last holdout would sign.

He turned. “Well?” he said. “This house needs everyone.”

The wind stilled. The pen hovered, trembling.

The scene held its breath.
