# Just-Right Trap
*Tech Suspense / Refugee Allegory*

**Logline:** A bear refugee family realizes every “perfect” comfort in their hideout is a surveillance lure planted by honey-voiced tracker Goldilocks.

============================================================

The cabin door slid open before Mama Bear’s paw reached the panel, flooding the porch with a light so warm it nearly masked the chemical tang beneath. She flinched; Papa Bear stiffened behind her, his paw tightening on their cub’s shoulder. Baby Bear, oblivious, darted inside, laughter echoing in the vaulted silence.

“Welcome, Bären family,” intoned a voice—genderless, honeyed, wrong.  
The foyer glowed “just right.” The thermostat blinked to life: 21.3°C. In the kitchen, three steaming bowls waited, names etched in gentle script—Papa, Mama, Baby—porridge thick as nostalgia, aroma oddly muted.

Papa Bear circled the room, scanning seams, eyeing vents. Mama Bear forced a smile, trailing a finger along the countertop’s edge. The surface pulsed faintly beneath her touch, reading her, cataloguing.  
She found a camera nestled in a brass lamp—disguised as a floral motif, barely visible. She angled the lamp toward the wall, hiding the lens.  
“Let’s be grateful,” she murmured, though her heart pounded. “We’re safe now.”  
Safe enough, she meant. For now.

Baby Bear bounced onto a chair, which hissed and shifted, sculpting itself around him. “It fits perfect!” he chirped, voice mirrored by the house’s assistant: “Welcome, Baby. Comfort optimized.”  
Papa Bear flinched. His bowl clattered against the table—spilling algorithmic porridge.  
Mama Bear’s legal mind flickered through precedent: gifts that are obligations, contracts with invisible ink. The law ended at the forest’s edge; here, suspicion was her only shield.

She moved to the bedroom. The bed adjusted as she approached, sheets smoothing, mattress firming—“just right.” Too right. She pressed a pillow, felt a subtle indentation. Sensors.  
A window flashed with forest green, then, for a blink, reflected a hovering drone—gone before she could call Papa to see.

She returned to the main room, found Papa Bear prying at a wall panel, pretending to check for drafts. Their eyes met.  
“Everything here fits us so well,” Papa said, voice flat.  
“Almost like someone knew exactly what we’d need,” she replied, too loud.

She covered the thermostat with her scarf, draped a towel over the lamp, angled the chair from the window. Small acts—maternal, defensive, subversive.  
Baby Bear, half-asleep, whispered, “Do we get to stay this time?”  
“Of course, darling.” She smoothed his fur, mouth set.

Above them, the heating vent clicked, a soft electric sigh. Somewhere inside the walls, something listened, waiting for their guard to drop.

Outside, night deepened; inside, comfort tightened to a noose.

Mama Bear’s eyes stayed open long after the others slept, watching the shadows for the first sign that sanctuary was, in fact, a snare.

A metallic knock jolted the cabin’s hush. Mama Bear’s fur bristled—a reflex, even here. She tucked Baby Bear behind her, signaled Papa with a glance, and slid the security latch. The door swung inward on Goldilocks’s smile: slick yellow raincoat, government badge lanyard flashing, a tote bag brimming with promise.

“Your safe haven at last!” Goldilocks’s voice was honey, her gaze sweeping the entryway, cataloguing sensors. Rainwater dripped from her boots and pooled on the woven mat. “Oh, you’ve made it cozy—just look at these adaptive mood lights! And that’s the new Series-S hearth, isn’t it?”

She moved like she owned the place. Her fingers grazed the smart-panel, toggling warmth and music—a gentle chime fluttered through the air, too sweet, too rehearsed. Papa Bear’s shoulders sagged with relief; Baby Bear darted to the kitchen, entranced by the glowing appliance that pulsed with every footstep.

Mama Bear smiled tightly, watching Goldilocks kneel beside the hearth, slip a thumb-sized puck beneath the log bin. “Security node,” Goldilocks explained, “part of your protection package. Invisible to intruders—keeps your family safe.” She winked at Baby Bear, who giggled and handed her a screwdriver.

Another node disappeared beneath the window seat. “Your windows will tint automatically if any threat’s detected,” Goldilocks purred, as if bestowing gifts. She ran a diagnostic on the biometric chairs—“You’ll always have the seat that fits you just right”—while her other hand tucked a wafer-thin antenna into the upholstery.

Mama Bear’s heart thudded. She catalogued every movement. The scent of pine mingled with the sharp tang of ozone; the fire’s warmth now threaded with the faint, unnerving hum of circuitry. “Who monitors all this data?” she asked, voice pleasant, eyes sharp.

Goldilocks’s smile never wavered. “Only those who care about your safety. You’re finally home, Mama Bear. You can let your guard down.”

Papa Bear ran his paw along a new node, shrugged, and forced a grateful smile. “No more wolves at the door, then.”

Mama Bear’s jaw clenched. She watched Baby Bear twirl in the LED light, innocence reflected in the smart-glass. She wanted to smash the hidden eyes, but the weight of exile pressed her still. Instead, she unplugged the kettle, feigning accident, and watched Goldilocks’s eyes flicker, just for a second.

Outside, the rain thickened, drumming out the world. Inside, comfort pulsed with invisible nerves. Mama Bear whispered to her mate, “Keep watch tonight.” She poured tea, but her mind mapped every node, every blind spot, every escape.

Goldilocks’s smile lingered as she slipped from room to room, planting her seeds. The cabin glowed golden, but Mama Bear tasted iron on her tongue.

In the silence after, the hearth flickered—then blinked, once, as if winking at a secret only the watcher could see.

The hum beneath the floorboards had grown sharper overnight—a mosquito’s whine threading through the hush. Mama Bear pressed her ear to the knotted pine, muscles tight. Papa Bear snored in the next room, Baby Bear curled in a quilt’s hollow; the cabin, for a moment, seemed to breathe with them. But the air held a metallic tang, a faint ozone edge that didn’t belong.

She slid the rug aside. Her claws, steady from years spent parsing legal briefs and pawing through evidence files, found the seam—a thin, unnatural groove where timber met a sliver of brushed steel. She pried it open. Cold metal stared back: a cluster of micro-antennas, each no bigger than a splinter, blinking in perfect rhythm with her heartbeat.

A pulse of dread swept through her, old courtroom instincts flaring. She remembered the “aid worker” with the golden hair, the way she’d lingered by the hearth, her hands busy, her smile too bright. Mama Bear’s paw hovered over the circuit. She imagined the signal arcing through the canopy, straight to the task-force’s grid—her family’s location triangulated, their “asylum” already breached.

She worked fast, heart pounding. One by one, she snapped the antennas, copper and plastic crunching beneath her claws. The lights flickered. Somewhere outside, the drone of engines swelled, low and predatory—closer.

A floorboard squeaked. Papa Bear appeared, eyes wide, voice low. “What are you doing?”

She stuffed the broken pieces into the stove, flames licking at the evidence. “We’re not alone,” she whispered, urgency threading her words. “They’re watching us—now.”

He stared at the ruined floor, then at her—fear, accusation, and trust in uneasy balance. In the other room, Baby Bear stirred, a small shape silhouetted by the glow of an LED blinking from the window frame. Another antenna, another eye.

“We need to go,” Papa Bear said, but Mama Bear shook her head. Through the walls came the faint, coded crackle of radios: coordinates, numbers, a lullaby in reverse.

She grabbed her child, pressed him close. “No more running,” she breathed. “Not this time.”

Outside, a searchlight swept between the trees, white and merciless. The cabin’s walls shivered with the approach. Mama Bear’s claws tightened. If sanctuary was a snare, she would turn the trap on its makers.

The door rattled—once, then again. The family held their breath as the shadows thickened, waiting for the first blow.

Papa Bear’s voice was a whisper, rough and close. “They’re watching. Every second you wait—”

“I know.” Mama Bear’s hands shook, but her eyes never left the bowl. The metal was cold, flecked with yesterday’s crust. She slid it across the table, steady now, ignoring the micro-camera’s glassy wink above the hearth. “Give me the wire.”

Baby Bear whimpered. "Will it hurt?" His breath clouded in the hush—the heat had cut out minutes ago, the smart-cabin’s gentle hum replaced by a predatory silence. Outside, a drone’s whir throbbed like a second heartbeat.

“Not us.” Mama Bear’s voice was iron. “Only the eyes.” She knelt, hands deep in the tangle of scavenged circuits, her fur prickling with static. Each movement felt like a trespass. The law was clear: sabotage meant exile—or worse. But the law had never lived in glass cages.

Papa Bear hovered, jaw tight. “If you’re wrong—”

“We die anyway,” she snapped, then softer, “Let me try.”

She wedged the copper coil around the bowl’s rim, thumb fumbling at the exposed leads. Old instincts warred with new necessity: she’d once argued for restraint, for trusting process. Now, every word of the law tasted like ash.

Baby Bear pressed against her side, eyes wide, searching for comfort. She could only offer truth.

“After this, nothing will taste the same,” she said, and handed him the trigger.

A blue arc spat across the metal. The cabin’s lights stuttered, screens blanking out mid-sentence, a thousand digital eyes going blind. The drone’s whir outside became a scream, then nothing. The EMP’s pulse rattled the bowl, sent a metallic tang through the air—ion and burnt porridge.

Then—silence. Not peace, but a pause so deep it pressed against their chests. The forest outside crept in, alive with the rustle of needles, the snap of a startled bird. The digital cocoon was gone. Only their breath, rough and real, remained.

Papa Bear exhaled. “Is it over?”

Mama Bear stared at the dead bowl, at the ruined comfort of home. “We’ve bought seconds. Maybe less.”

A shadow flickered past the window—Goldilocks’s countermeasures, or worse. Mama Bear pulled her family close, heart hammering in the hush.

The forest listened, waiting to see who would trespass next.

A siren split the cabin’s hush, then everything went dark—screens dead, sensors mute, the digital pulse of safety cut mid-beat. Mama Bear’s breath sharpened. She reached for her daughter, felt the small, trembling hand find hers in the blackout. The boy pressed close, silent except for the chuff of panic in his chest. All around them, the IoT’s artificial comfort vanished, replaced by the primal dark and the raw scent of ozone.  

Footsteps thudded overhead—a stampede in the corridor as the newcomers scattered, voices ricocheting off steel and timber. “Stay close,” Mama Bear hissed, her lawyer’s poise stripped to the bone. “Don’t trust the walls.” She crouched, gathering her family, spine pressed to the cold frame of a dead touchscreen panel.  

Somewhere deeper in the cabin, a crash—glass or plastic, impossible to tell. In the dark, every noise was magnified. She remembered a case file: predators in the wild always struck during confusion. Her mind mapped the layout, calculated escape routes, but the blackout left her blind, her legal logic useless.  

Red strobes flickered to life—emergency diodes painting the corridor in wounds of color. In the sudden flare, she glimpsed movement: a slender figure darting between shadows. Goldilocks. The agent’s pale braid flashed once in the red light, then vanished behind a bulkhead, her silhouette trailing a snake of loose cabling. For a heartbeat, their eyes met—one sharp, calculating, the other burning with a mother’s fury.  

Mama Bear lunged, nearly catching Goldilocks’s arm, but the agent slipped away, impossibly quick. In her wake, a ceiling panel crashed down, scattering frightened children. Goldilocks paused—just long enough to shove a stunned boy clear before vanishing into a service shaft, her comlink sparking in her fist.  

Papa Bear’s hand gripped her shoulder. “Medical files—the lock’s down, I can get them.” He was already moving, torn between bureaucratic hope and the instinct to hide. Mama Bear yanked him back. “No. Safety first. We move as one.”  

A drone’s camera winked dead on the wall, its blank eye impotent. Mama Bear’s fingers found the device’s base and wrenched it from its socket—a small, defiant violence.  

Somewhere, Goldilocks’s voice crackled over a dying channel: “Nest is compromised. Feathers still numbered.”  

The family pressed into the dark, guided by touch, not trust. The blackout’s chaos had ended the illusion—home was a trap, the forest outside no longer more dangerous than the walls within.  

A distant generator sputtered, threatening to revive the grid. Mama Bear’s heart hammered as she led her family deeper into the uncertain dark, every step a wager between hope and exposure.  

Behind them, the emergency lights flickered—then, with a final pulse, died.

A spoon clattered to the floor. Mama Bear froze, hand hovering over the steaming porridge, her ears tuned to the pulse of the room—three families crammed into the cabin’s shadowed warmth, every movement tight with the knowledge that safety was a narrowed margin, a rumor.

“Drone sweep—north quadrant!” Baby Bear hissed, hunched over the mesh of screens behind the patched sofa. Red light strobed across the window, fractured by Faraday mesh. Outside, the forest pressed close, ancient hush threaded with the low whir of surveillance.

“Protocol Two,” Mama Bear commanded, voice steady though her heart stuttered. Her paw found the micro-antenna hidden in the mantle, snapping it with a surgeon’s precision. Static crackled. The cabin’s woodsmoke-and-cinnamon air soured with the tang of shorted circuitry.

Papa Bear was already at the door, code-tapping the hidden latch for the false hearth. The youngest refugee—a trembling vole child—clung to his leg, wide-eyed. “Quickly,” he whispered, his bulk gentle as he ushered them into the cavity beneath the floorboards, where every plank was mapped but none betrayed its secret.

A coded knock at the rear—two long, one short—summoned Mama Bear to the kitchen, where a gaunt raccoon mother pressed a battered ID chip into her paw. “They know our names,” the raccoon whispered. “Do we run or do we vanish?”

Mama Bear’s claws shook as she slotted the chip into her forger, her mind flickering through statutes, precedents, the dull ache of every law twisted against them. “We erase, we rewrite, we move. But this time, we do not scatter alone.” She looked at the huddled families, at Papa Bear’s haunted eyes, at her own son’s fingers ghosting over firewall code. “The Railroad is live. Every cabin, every den—tonight, they move together.”

The plan unfurled in terse, low voices: encrypted signals pulsed from the patchwork quilts, safe-houses mapped by children’s drawings, not data. Baby Bear spun up cloaking protocols, his exhilaration fighting the tremor in his hands. “They call it security,” Mama Bear said, voice iron. “I call it trespass. Tonight, the map is ours.”

Outside, the drone’s searchlight swept past, unseeing. Inside, porridge cooled, untouched. The old comforts—bed, hearth, bowl—became tools and signals, repurposed for flight.

In the hush that followed, a new resolve thickened the air. The Bear Underground was not just surviving. It was learning, linking, resisting. When the time came, Mama Bear would lead them out—not into hiding, but into a world remade for those who demand their privacy be “just right.”

A distant crash split the night—another cabin breached, or a decoy sprung? Mama Bear tightened her grip on the forged chip, gaze fixed on the door. “Ready,” she whispered.

Outside, the forest waited—dark, dangerous, alive with possibility.
