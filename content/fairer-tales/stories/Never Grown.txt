# Never Grown
*Post-Apocalyptic Adventure / Psychological Thriller*

**Logline:** The last adult in plague-scarred Neverland struggles to rehabilitate feral children while Peter Pan violently erases any memory of the lost world.

============================================================

The bow of the Jolly Responder scraped against the corroded dock, the shriek of metal on barnacle and bone splintering the jungle hush. Captain James Hooke stood braced at the helm, knuckles white, sweat slicking the inside of his battered field jacket. Children flitted through the shadowed palms—bare-legged, half-wild—eyes sharp with hunger, suspicion, and something older than either. He counted their faces by reflex, lips moving in a silent triage: fever, laceration, limp. The smallest—Milo, he thought, though names here were as fragile as the glass vials in his satchel—clutched a bloodied rag to his arm.

Hooke’s boots thudded onto warped planks. The scent of antiseptic bled into brine and rotting sugar, the ghost of carnival spun to ruin. He hefted a crate marked with the faded red cross, feeling every ounce in his bad shoulder. Behind him, the ship’s engine coughed, then fell silent—a wounded animal’s last breath.

“Medicine spoils in this heat,” Hooke called, not looking up. “Fetch the cold-box. Quickly.” The words sounded like an order but felt like a plea.

No one moved. The children’s leader—a girl with a jagged scar bisecting her cheek—watched him without blinking, fingers curled around a stick sharpened to a point. Hooke knelt, snapping open the crate. Penicillin, bandages, a sealed envelope—one of their “History Letters,” unopened. He hesitated, thumb tracing the wax seal, then shoved it deeper inside.

A rock clattered near his foot. Milo edged forward, lip trembling. “Will it hurt?” he whispered.

“Only for a moment,” Hooke said, voice thick. He cleaned the wound, hands trembling, the memory of another child—another time—rising unbidden. He pressed gauze, wrapped the arm, and did not meet the boy’s eyes. Around them, the carousel’s broken melody warbled through the trees, laughter twisted into lament.

From the jungle, a voice like a mocking wind: “Why drag them back to pain, Captain? Let them forget—it’s kinder.”

Hooke’s jaw worked, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he pressed a battered music box into Milo’s palm. “For you. If you remember how to wind it.”

He looked up—one of the children had vanished. The others eyed the crate, the ship, the jungle. Hooke’s heart pounded: how many would come next time? How many would be lost to fever, or to Pan’s shadow?

A sudden gust rattled the ferris wheel. The ship’s rigging groaned, a clock ticking down. Hooke slung the satchel over his shoulder, resolve flickering, battered but unbroken.

He scanned the tree line—already, he sensed Peter watching. The next delivery would be harder. He would not give up. Not yet.

The jungle seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the first move.

A crackle, a hiss—then the flames leapt, hungry and bright, licking up the sides of the medicine crates stacked beneath the fractured archway of the Funhouse. The Lost Boys shrieked and scattered, faces smeared with ash and glee, their laughter ricocheting off rusted carousel horses and shattered mirrors. Someone—Tootles or Curly—brandished a burning stick like a sword. “No more tonic! No more nurse!” they jeered, hopping from foot to foot as the plastic ampoules bubbled and burst, sending up plumes of sweet, chemical smoke.

Captain James Hooke broke through the tangled undergrowth, boots slapping mud. He caught Slightly by the collar, spun him around; the boy twisted, eyes wide and wild, reeking of adrenaline and fear. “What have you done?” Hooke’s voice was hoarse, scraped raw by disbelief and smoke. He scanned the inferno—labels blistering, glass shattering. The last shipment, medicine for the fever already creeping through camp.

“Don’t want it!” a squat boy spat, eyes shining with something like triumph, something like terror. “Peter said it makes you old. Makes you remember. We don’t want to remember.”

Hooke dropped Slightly, lunged for the crates. Heat slammed into him—the kind that peels skin, the kind he remembered from burning hospitals and broken bodies. He ripped at a half-melted box, yanked out a crumpled blister-pack, coughing as syrupy smoke clawed at his lungs. A hand yanked at his sleeve. Slightly again, trembling now. “Captain, it hurts—”

Behind them, Peter materialized, haloed in the flickering orange. His eyes glittered. “Let it burn, Jamie. Fevers break. Stories last.”

Hooke’s fists clenched. The urge to rage—to shout, to drag the arsonists into the dirt—rose sharp and bitter. Instead, he knelt, pulling Slightly closer, checking the boy’s pulse, his breath. “You’re not stories, you’re flesh,” he muttered. “You bleed.”

Peter only smiled, firelight dancing across his face, shadow swirling at his heels. “They’re happier this way.”

Glass popped. A spatter of hot syrup seared Hooke’s arm. He jerked back, vision swimming. The boys’ laughter had thinned to coughing. In the hush, a younger child doubled over, hacking, clutching his ribs.

Hooke pressed a damp cloth to Slightly’s mouth, met Peter’s gaze across the flames. “You’re killing them,” he said, voice breaking. But Peter was already gone, shadow slipping away between the trees.

Ash drifted down, soft as snow. In the glow, Hooke cradled a ruined vial, lips moving in silent prayer. Somewhere behind him, a cough broke the silence, sharp and ragged—a promise of the fever to come.

Hooke looked up, jaw set. The medicine was gone. The children needed saving more than ever.

He stood, eyes scanning the darkness for the shape of his enemy—knowing, now, that he would have to face Peter, and the truth, head-on.

Hooke burst through the underbrush, thorns tearing at his sleeves, the echo of a child’s scream ricocheting through the ruined midway. He stumbled into what had once been the Funhouse—now a makeshift infirmary, or laboratory, or both. The air was thick with a sweetness that made his teeth ache: burnt sugar, and beneath it, something metallic. A fine, silvery dust drifted on the shafts of weak sunlight leaking through the torn canopy above, swirling in the heavy air.

Peter stood at the center, his silhouette sharp against the carousel’s decayed horses. He held a battered tin shaker in one hand—the source of the dust, glimmering with each careless flick of his wrist. Two children knelt at his feet, heads bowed, eyes glassy with anticipation. A third girl—bruised, wild-haired—struggled in the grip of a Lost Boy twice her size, her mouth pressed tight against his palm.

“Let her go!” Hooke’s voice cracked like a gunshot, startling the nearest child into a whimper. He forced himself forward, boots scraping over broken glass and moss. “Peter, what are you doing?”

Peter didn’t turn. He tipped the shaker, allowing a slow fall of dust to settle over the kneeling children’s crowns. Their faces slackened, then bloomed with vacant smiles.

“They were crying, Captain,” Peter said, his voice as light as a nursery rhyme. “Now they won’t remember why.” He spun, eyes shining with unnatural glee. “Isn’t that what you want? Happy children, forever.”

Hooke’s gut twisted. He saw the dust still clinging to his own prosthetic hook, dulling its steel. He wiped it off on his coat, leaving a grey smear, and knelt by the girl. “No,” he whispered, searching her eyes for recognition. “No, you need to remember. It hurts, I know. But it’s you. It’s all you have.”

The Lost Boy wrenched her back, presenting her like an offering. Peter advanced, dust glittering. “Don’t interfere, Hooke. You fix bodies. I fix hearts.”

Hooke’s hand closed around the girl’s wrist. “You’re erasing them. Who will they be when you’re done?”

Peter cocked his head, smile curdling. “They’ll be happy. Isn’t that enough?”

The girl jerked in Hooke’s grasp, sobbing. “Please,” she breathed, “make it stop—make it all go away.”

He faltered. His hand hovered between her pleading face and the dust. Mercy or memory—ruin her, or save her to suffer? His own failures howled in the hollow of his chest.

A shadow flickered on the wall—a child’s outline, severed from its body, writhing. Hooke shuddered and pulled the girl behind him, voice trembling: “You’re not saving anyone, Peter. Not this way.”

Peter’s eyes narrowed. “You want pain? Fine. Remember this.”

He raised the shaker, flinging dust in Hooke’s face. Cold numbness crawled over Hooke’s skin. For one terrible heartbeat, he longed to surrender. Then he squeezed the girl’s hand, anchoring himself in her terror.

The dust cleared. Hooke staggered, blinking back oblivion. The children stared, expectant, as Peter advanced again—shaker poised, smile sharp, ready to erase.

The carousel creaked to life, music box tune warped and menacing. The battle for memory had begun.

[END SCENE]

The wind tore at them, wild with salt and rust, as Hooke climbed the last broken steps to the cliff’s edge. Peter stood there already—bare feet curled over the crumbling concrete, eyes empty-bright, feral. Below, the jungle clawed at the bones of a carousel, its music long since devoured by the surf.

Hooke stopped, chest heaving. “You called them, Peter. The children. I know what you’re doing.”

Peter’s smile was all teeth. “They come because they want to forget. Grown-ups always make them bleed.”

Hooke’s hand—his real hand—hung at his side, knuckles white. The other, hidden in a battered leather glove, trembled. He drew it slow, unfastening the strap with his teeth. Metal caught the bruised light: battered, salt-pitted, the fingers more tool than flesh. He held it out, palm open, arm shaking.

“It won’t cut you anymore,” Hooke said, his voice almost lost to the wind.

Peter’s gaze darted to the hand, then away. The wind flung his hair across his face, boyish and wild. “You think that thing scares me?” He laughed, but it cracked at the edges. “You want me to remember what you lost? Why should I?”

Hooke stepped closer. “Because forgetting is what’s killing them. I can’t fix what’s gone, Peter. But we could start again. All I’m asking—” He swallowed, the sound raw. “Take my hand. Just once. Let them see it’s possible.”

For a moment, the world narrowed to the stretch of battered metal bridging the space between them. Peter’s feet shifted, toes gripping the edge, as if ready to fly or fall. Below, the ferris wheel groaned in the wind—a rusted heartbeat.

Peter didn’t move. His eyes were wide, unblinking, a child’s terror in the body of a king. “It looks heavy,” he whispered.

“It is,” Hooke said. “But I’m still here.”

The silence pressed in—a single, perilous heartbeat. Hooke kept his hand extended, refusing to flinch, though the wind threatened to take him over with it. For a moment, Peter seemed to waver.

Then, from the jungle behind, a chorus of voices rose—children, searching, afraid. Peter’s face twisted, defiance warring with something older and more fragile. He spun from the edge, vanishing into the shadows, leaving Hooke alone, hand outstretched to the empty air.

The first fat drops of rain began to fall. Hooke lowered his arm, the metal cold against his chest. Somewhere, the carousel’s broken tune caught the wind, and the children’s cries grew louder.

He turned toward the jungle, jaw set. There was still time—if he could reach them before Peter made them forget again.

A shaft of sickly sunlight sliced through the boarded-up window, falling across the warped floorboards and the photograph trembling in Peter’s outstretched hand.

Hooke’s voice still echoed, low and insistent, “—found it in the old nursery, Peter, under the bed.” But Peter didn’t hear him. Not really. The children clustered in the shadows, feral eyes flickering with something like hope, something like fear.

The photo’s edges were curled, black mold spidering across the faded image. A woman’s smile—soft, familiar, impossible. A ghost looking out, her arms open as if to gather him in.

Peter’s knuckles whitened. For a moment, his face twisted in a parody of his usual grin. “Just a silly picture,” he chirped, voice too high, too brittle. “She’s not real. She never—”

The word caught. His hand shook. A drip of blood blossomed on his palm where the paper had sliced him. He stared, wild-eyed, as if the wound were a trick.

A Lost Boy edged forward, whispering, “Is that your mum, Peter?”

Peter recoiled, clutching the photo to his chest. He could smell lavender, talc, the distant sweetness of a memory he’d walled away. The broken calliope outside wheezed a tuneless note, and somewhere, the metallic tick of the old crocodile ride staggered through the hush.

“She’s not—” Peter tried again, but his voice cracked. The children watched, wide-eyed, as the bravado crumbled. His laughter curdled into a choked sob.

Hooke stepped closer, gentle but unyielding. “You remember her. That’s why it hurts.”

Peter flung the photograph across the room. It fluttered, landing face-down in a patch of sunlight. “I don’t want to remember!” he screamed. “I don’t want to feel it!” The words tore out of him, raw, animal, echoing through the ruined park.

For the first time, the children saw Peter shudder and shrink, his silhouette smaller, his shadow curling on itself. Tears streaked his dirty cheeks. A boy, not a legend.

Outside, thunder rumbled—a storm building at the edge of the jungle. Vines shivered against the glass, pressing inward.

Peter’s gaze darted from the photo to Hooke, to the children, to the dark corners where memory crouched. He staggered backward, breathing ragged. Then, with a wild, broken cry, he bolted for the door—fleeing into the overgrown wild, leaving the photograph and his sanctuary shattered behind him.

The children stared after him, the world suddenly changed.

Hooke bent and picked up the photograph, thumb tracing the cracked face.

Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall.

A crash—wood splintering, a boy’s startled shriek. Hooke jerked upright, heart hammering, hand instinctively pressed to the stitched scar at his side. The Lost Boys had bolted from the carousel’s shadowed mouth, trampling the line of scavenged benches he’d laid out for his first “school.” Dust swirled in shafts of bruised sunlight. Overhead, the Ferris wheel creaked—a skeletal sentinel, its silhouette splitting the choking canopy.

“Stop!” Hooke’s voice cracked the hush, sharp but not cruel. He stepped between them and the pathless jungle, boots crunching old popcorn beneath his heel. “No one’s leaving. Not yet.”

The boys froze. Their faces were masks—painted with grime, eyes ringed by hunger and something older, harder: terror at what he was about to ask.

He forced his hands open, palms visible. “You remember how to sit, don’t you?” He tried for a smile, failed. “That’s all I want. For now.”

They slunk back, sullen and wary, to the benches. Hooke knelt beside the broken carousel horse he’d dragged in as a relic—its once-golden mane tangled with vines. He laid his battered medkit atop it and fumbled for a stub of chalk, white dust igniting in the air.

“Today, we remember.” He drew a rough circle on a cracked plank. “Not stories. Not dreams. What’s real. One memory—each of you. Doesn’t matter if it’s ugly.” His voice wavered. “Especially if it’s ugly.”

A boy named Noah pressed his fists to his eyes. “Peter says memories are poison. He says—if we forget, nothing hurts.”

Hooke’s throat tightened. He rolled up his sleeve, exposing the ragged scar puckered across his forearm. “This is what I carry. I remember how I got it. I remember the screaming. But I’m still here. You are, too.”

Silence. Then, a whisper—barely breath. “...the smoke smelled like burnt sugar. My mum was—” Noah’s voice broke. Chalk fell from his fingers, rattling on the deck.

Another hand, small and shaking, closed around his. Hooke’s own memories surged—blood, sirens, the taste of salt and fear. He steadied his breath, held the boy’s gaze. “You survived,” he said, soft as confession. “Let the memory stay.”

Above, the Ferris wheel shuddered. From somewhere deeper in the overgrowth, a chill laughter—Pan’s laughter—skittered across the ruins. The boys huddled closer, eyes wide.

Hooke looked at their faces, saw the first flicker of hope—and terror—kindling beneath the grime.

“Again,” he said, voice low, urgent. “Before it’s taken from you. Again.”

The carousel horses watched, hollow-eyed, as the Lost Boys began to speak. And in the shadows, something moved.
