*['Tragic Fable', 'Eco-Thriller']*

**Logline:** A gentle cloud-farmer giant must save his starving sky-folk after serial burglar Jack fells the only beanstalk that feeds them.

============================================================

Nimbus snatched a falling pod midair before it could roll off the trembling terrace. His fingers, thick but impossibly gentle, cupped the golden bean—light shimmered through its translucent skin, casting a fleeting coin-shaped glow on the vapor-woven planks below. Thunder grumbled beneath Stratopolis, distant but insistent. Nimbus exhaled, slow and measured, as if the whole city’s balance depended on it.

He turned, cataloging damage: one snapped vine, wilt at the root crown, leaves stippled with pale spots. His lips moved in a soft litany—“Phaseolus caelestis, cluster six, pod drop, stem fracture”—as he pressed the bean to his cheek, drawing comfort from its living hum. He set it in his ledger’s velvet-lined hollow, hands trembling.

Above, the sky-vines coiled along spiraled trellises, their golden pods swaying in the storm-breath. Nimbus moved among them with reverence, pruning dead tips, mending a slashed node with a sliver of cloud-fiber, each action precise as a surgeon’s stitch. His mind mapped the root lattice, every connection, every risk. He felt the city’s hunger as a physical ache.

A breeze carried voices—sharp, dismissive—from the far terrace. “Nimbus! You’re behind schedule,” barked Supervisor Fenn, arms crossed, gaze flicking from Nimbus’s careful hands to the ledger’s meticulous rows. “We need yield, not more of your… rituals.”

Nimbus straightened, words coiling behind his teeth. He tried for neutrality. “The root matrix is destabilizing. If we lose another cluster, the terrace will—”

Fenn waved him off. “You worry too much. The beans always come back.” A forced laugh. “Just pick faster. Leave the rest to the wind.”

Nimbus’s jaw worked. He glanced at the snapped vine, then at his own ledger—an unbroken record of every stress and storm. He considered, for a heartbeat, using the untested accelerator compound in his pouch—a gamble that might restore the crop, or ruin it forever. His thumb hovered over the vial.

But procedure mattered. Life mattered. Nimbus pocketed the compound, choosing patience over panic. Instead, he broke ration protocol, plucking a single, perfect pod and slipping it to a gaunt apprentice who watched with hollow eyes. The boy mouthed thanks. Nimbus’s heart twisted; he’d risked censure, but hunger was worse.

As Nimbus turned back to the vines, he paused. A cluster was missing entirely. Not blighted—taken. His breath caught. He scanned the terrace: no footprints, just a faint scuff on the cloud-damp edge, as if someone lighter, nimbler, had come and gone.

He pressed trembling fingers to the ledger, marking an absence. Outside, thunder sharpened. Something vital was slipping through his hands.

Hook: In the shadow of the next terrace, a figure lurked, eyes fixed on the golden crop—Jack had found his way into Stratopolis.

A brittle silence split the greenhouse dome, broken only by the distant, unsteady thunder grumbling beneath Stratopolis. Jack’s shadow flickered along the crystalline terraces—knife in one hand, damp satchel slung across his narrow shoulders. The security latches had been child’s play; he’d watched the patrols, mapped their blind spots, slipped through the trembling sky-vine bridges as if he belonged here.

Now, inside the seed vault, he moved quick and silent. The air shimmered with golden light: rows of pods nested like swaddled infants, each cradled in a matrix of moss and humming with faint, honeyed warmth. He hesitated, just once. The pods’ spiral patterns—strange, beautiful—reminded him of something fragile he’d ruined as a boy. His fingers hovered.

He heard a voice—Nimbus’s, distant through the glass. “The irrigation pressure’s wrong! Something’s off—” Sharp, precise, ignored by the elders stampeding past. Jack’s heart thudded as he forced himself forward, slicing the first pod free. It oozed a thread of gold onto his palm; the smell was sweet, sickly, alive.

Jack stuffed the pods—one, two, three—into his satchel. Alarms did not sound, not yet. Protocol required forms, signatures, belief in order. The only witness was a scorch-petaled sky-flower, drifting down in the hot, charged air.

Outside, Nimbus’s huge silhouette darted between consoles. He catalogued losses, hands trembling over readouts, voice rising. “If even one pod is missing—” But the councilor cut him off. “Enough. We need real solutions, not numbers.”

A low, animal panic began to pulse through the city—hunger in the thunder, fear in the hushed crowds. Nimbus, frantic, scanned for breaches, his meticulous warnings lost in the swell. He saw the hairline crack in the dome, the faint trail of golden sap, and understood with a sickening clarity: the cycle was broken.

Jack ducked through the exit just as the greenhouse lights flickered—one pod slipping from his bag, splitting open on the lattice. Roots burst outward, writhing, seeding the storm-lit air with bitter pollen. He fled, gold heavy at his side, not daring to look back.

Above, the storm paused—one heartbeat, no thunder—before the alarms finally howled. Stratopolis’s beauty fractured; the city’s hunger, once silent, echoed out in a single, terrible cry.

Nimbus pressed his hand to the wound in the dome, golden sap staining his skin. “We won’t survive this,” he whispered.

Down below, Jack vanished into the gathering dark.

Chainsaw teeth bit deep. The beanstalk, alive with sap and centuries of silent memory, shrieked as Jack forced steel through its emerald heart. Clouds curdled around his boots, the metal’s snarl devouring Stratopolis’s dawn song. Each pass sent tremors through the sky-vines above—terrestrial violence unspooling in the air.

Jack’s jaw set. No more climbing, no more eyes watching from above. He barely glanced at the sap that spattered his cuffs, gold and green. Below, Stratopolis flickered: terraces trembling, bridges swaying, citizens pouring from their homes in confusion and dread. Jack yanked the starter again. “Just a plant,” he muttered, blind to the birds startled from their woven nests, the way the sky itself seemed to close ranks against him.

The final cut. A thunderclap—no, the stalk’s own death-cry. The beanstalk listed, then fell, shattering cloud and peace alike. Its segments tumbled, trailing leaves and petals in a slow-motion rain. The terraces shuddered, a thousand feet above the storm’s hungry roar. Debris hammered the sky-vine bridges, snapped supports. Light dimmed as the city’s lifeline bled out, sap streaming in golden rivulets down through the mist.

Nimbus was already moving. His senses—overwhelmed, raw—registered the shift before the rest. He pressed his palm to a sky-vine, felt its pulse flutter and fade. Terror rippled through the crowd: “The harvest! The rains! What will we eat—?” Their panic was a storm unto itself.

He knelt, hands trembling, and traced the root-ends where the beanstalk once anchored. “It’s not dead,” he whispered, half to the vine, half to himself. “Roots remember how to grow.” His mind mapped the city’s food chains—the terraces, the seed vaults, the backup graftings—each contingency dismissed so often by others as “cloud-headed nonsense.” Now it was all they had.

“Listen to me!” Nimbus’s voice quivered, uneven. Neighbors recoiled, eyeing him with suspicion. “If we work—now—we can graft the runners. Save the old seed. But we have to—”  
“Aren’t you the one who let him up there?” someone spat.  
Nimbus flinched, then squared his shoulders. “Blame me later. If we don’t act, the roots dry out and there won’t be a city left to fight for.”

A child clung to his coat, eyes wide. Nimbus squeezed their hand, then stood: “Follow me. Bring tools. Water. Every minute counts.” His instructions came in urgent bursts—precise, strange, vital. Some neighbors hesitated, but others fell in behind him, desperation outweighing doubt.

Above, stormlight flickered in the shattered sky. The city groaned, suspended between survival and oblivion.

Somewhere below, Jack vanished into the thunder—a single cut now echoing through every trembling root.

Nimbus led his unlikely cohort toward the wounded terraces, hope battered but unbroken, as the clouds closed in.

Nimbus’s boots skidded on the rain-slicked rim of the terrace. Jack was already halfway across the last sky-vine, sack bulging with stolen cloud-gold, his laughter swallowed by thunder. Below, the storm churned—a roiling, endless fall.

Nimbus’s fingers tightened on the megabean. The city’s last hope. Jack didn’t look back. No one ever listened—not until it was too late.

He ran.

Nimbus sprang from the edge, hurtling into the wind. The world narrowed to the scream of air and the cold slap of mist. Jack froze mid-stride, eyes wide, disbelief flickering into panic as Nimbus plummeted toward him—not to tackle, but to the void beneath the trembling bridge.

Nimbus’s mind was a white-hot calculus: wind speed, root structure, the humidity of cloud-mist. There was only one chance. He wrenched the megabean from his belt, pressed it to his lips.

“Grow—not in anger, but in need,” he whispered, voice lost to the storm.

He flung the bean downward, bare fingers slicing a seam in the vapor. In the instant between heartbeats, the world held its breath.

The stalk erupted. A crack like the sky splitting. Verdant, impossible, it speared upward—through Nimbus’s outstretched hand, past his tumbling body, tearing the air with leaves sharp as razors and a trunk hard as ironwood. Jack’s cry was cut short; the stalk drove through him, pinning him mid-leap, blood blooming in the storm-lit air.

Nimbus caught a spray of sap and copper, sticky on his skin. The stalk’s growth slowed, shuddered. For a moment, it anchored him, leaves cradling his descent. He landed in the nest of green, breathless, shaking.

Jack’s sack tumbled, spilling gold into the clouds below.

The terraces above trembled, the city’s lights flickering in the sudden hush. Nimbus stared at his hands—sap and blood, life and death mingled. The stalk’s leaves already wilted at the edges, the megabean spent. Salvation, but at what cost?

Thunder rolled. Far below, the storm waited.

Nimbus looked up—toward the city that had never understood him, now depending on what he’d done.

A single leaf unfurled beside his face, trembling. In its shadow, Nimbus could not yet tell if he’d saved Stratopolis or doomed it.

Above, footsteps thundered on the trembling bridge. The city was coming.

Nimbus’s hands trembled, knuckles green-stained and raw, as he pressed his palm against the pulsing beanstalk. Below, the convoy’s bells tolled—a metallic clang, the sound warped by wind and altitude, warning that another cart was shifting its weight. The bridge—thicker than ten men’s span, slick with dew, veins aglow—shuddered beneath the load.

“Too much!” Nimbus barked, voice swallowed by thunder. He lurched along the living bridge, boots snagging on barbed tendrils, to intercept a ground-dweller guiding an overladen cart of grain. The groundling flinched at the giant’s shadow, but Nimbus only pointed, urgent, at the swelling node beneath the wheels. “Stop. There. You’ll split the stalk.”

The convoy captain, Jack’s chosen man, scowled, “We’re behind schedule! Who put you in charge—”  
Nimbus’s fingers twitched. He wanted to explain: the stalk’s xylem was flexing, the root hairs below already screaming, the whole bridge threatening to collapse if they rushed. But his tongue thickened, words bottlenecked by panic and static. He took a breath, reached down, and with deliberate care, guided the cart backward, his massive hands steady even as the world rocked.

Above, lanterns bobbed along the stalk, casting gold over the storm-pocked clouds. Jack himself watched from the mid-bridge, eyes narrowed—not at the cargo, but at the stalk’s veins, already plotting. Nimbus caught his gaze and held it. The thief grinned, feigning camaraderie, but his fingers traced invisible routes—old habits. Nimbus felt the old fear stir: would Jack poison this fragile truce from within?

A shout from behind—one of the earthborn agronomists, Raven, demanding they harvest the cloud-soil microbes now, before the stalk’s moisture waned. “We risk blight,” Nimbus managed, voice barely audible over the wind. “One wrong cut, and the city starves.”  
“Then you’ll be the one to blame,” Raven snapped, shoving past. Nimbus flinched at the contact, withdrew to the stalk’s edge, breathing the ozone and fear.

Another tremor—this one unnatural. The bridge swayed. Convoy bells shrieked. A crate skidded toward the abyss. Nimbus lunged, catching it one-handed, the weight nearly pitching him after. He braced, muscles burning, refusing to let go. Above, Jack shouted orders—too late, too loud, all for show.

Nimbus steadied the crate, then the bridge, then himself. The city’s fate hung in the balance—every heartbeat, every decision, a gamble. The beanstalk would hold. It must. He glanced down: the storm was close, hungry. One mistake, and the alliance—perhaps the world—would fall.

He looked up. At the stalk’s summit, Stratopolis shimmered, its terraces waiting. Another convoy ascended. Jack was already moving, whispering to a merchant, eyes bright with schemes. Nimbus wiped his palm on his tunic, heart hammering. There would be no turning back. The bridge was built, and so was the peril.

A child’s drawing—clouds and roots, a giant smiling—fluttered from his pocket, a fleeting kindness amid the storm. Nimbus squared his shoulders, stepping forward as the next crisis gathered on the trembling vine.

A crack split the thunderclouds as the ceremonial rope—woven from living sky-vines—snapped taut between Stratopolis and the earth’s highest terrace. Nimbus flinched at the sudden noise. The council chamber, suspended in the vapor-lit air, trembled beneath a dozen dignitaries and a hundred watching eyes.

“Begin,” the earth delegate declared, voice echoing off the glassy domes. Jack—too clean, too smooth in his new ambassador’s sash—flashed a grin at the cameras, while Nimbus’s hands worked unseen, steadying a tray of cloud-moss seedlings as if the world depended on their roots.

It did.

Nimbus moved to the table, sleeves damp with dew, and placed the tray between the two societies. “These are for you,” he said, voice soft but carrying. “They require patience. If you try to force a second harvest before their roots recover, you’ll lose them. Forever.” He glanced at Jack, who looked away.

A murmur fluttered through the chamber. The earth’s agriculture minister reached for a seedling, pausing as Nimbus’s broad palm covered hers. “Will you trust my methods?” he asked, the question barbed with memory—every slight, every dismissal echoing in the hush. “Or only when the fields are green?”

She hesitated. Across the chamber, a Stratopolitan elder whispered, “He’s too cautious. We need abundance now.” Nimbus’s jaw clenched. He forced his hand to release, letting the minister take the seedling. The choice hung in the humid air: rush and risk collapse, or trust in the slow, uncertain weave of care.

The accord was signed with a flourish—Jack’s signature bold, Nimbus’s careful, looping. Cheers thundered. Petals drifted from the sky-gardens, brushing Jack’s hair, gilding the treaty in borrowed gold. Nimbus stood motionless, dizzy from the noise, the flash of medals, the weight of hope and history. A child from the earth-side delegation hesitated at the yawning gap of the sky-vine bridge, staring down at the storm-lit abyss. Nimbus knelt, huge and gentle, and offered his hand.

“Together,” he said. The child’s small fingers closed around his.

But outside the domes, thunder gathered. In the vault beneath, the last golden egg glinted, untouched—for now. Jack’s smile faltered as Nimbus led the child across, the living bridge quivering underfoot, every step a wager against the old hunger. Above, the storm’s warning rolled on: fragile peace, or another fall?

The city held its breath.
