# Sugar Shelter
*Psychological Horror / Candy-Goth*

**Logline:** A retired social worker’s edible trauma refuge is misbranded a cannibal den exactly when meth-lord parents come to “claim” their abandoned kids.

============================================================

A brittle snap—too loud, too soon. Greta flinched, heart stuttering. A peppermint beam fractured beneath her trembling fingers, sticky shards tumbling into the syrup-muck at her boots. She pressed her palm to the break, the air thick with vanilla and the chemical hush of pheromones, trying to stifle her own panic before it could bleed into the walls.

Behind her, the children’s whispers fluttered—nervous, birdlike. She heard the older girl, Lena, hiss, “Don’t eat it yet. She said wait.” They’d seen the news on a scavenged phone: grainy photos, a lionized militia in camo, headlines screaming CANDY WITCH HIDES RUNAWAYS. Greta’s sanctuary now a punchline, a threat, a trigger for men with guns and parents with fists.

She forced her hands steady, smoothing a seam of frosting over the crack. Every edible brick, she reminded herself, was measured—sugar content controlled, pheromone release slow, tested on her own scarred wrists before she’d let a child near it. This was no fairy-tale trap. Still, the world outside was hungry for monsters.

A child’s cry rang out—a sharp, animal sound. Greta spun. Simon, the younger boy, had clawed at a wall, syrup glazing his fingers, panic wild in his eyes. “It’s melting! They’ll get in!” His voice pitched high, fear echoing from some remembered night she could never touch.

Greta knelt, ignoring the ache in her knees, pressing her stinging palm to his cheek. “The walls are sweet, but they’re strong,” she whispered, voice low, steady. She pressed her other hand to the candy—held it there until the pheromones began their slow work, the boy’s breathing hitching, then softening. Her own blood, bright and sticky, welled from a sugar burn she’d missed until now.

She forced a smile, though her throat was tight. “It smells like birthdays, doesn’t it?” Simon nodded, shuddering. Greta’s smile cracked—she’d never asked if he’d had one.

A low rumble sounded from the forest’s edge—distant, but wrong. Greta’s body tensed. She wiped blood and sugar on her skirt, rose, and surveyed her fragile kingdom: every wall a prayer, every sweet scent a shield. At the edge of the crystalline canopy, shadows shifted.

“Lena,” she called, voice sharp as peppermint, “gather the others. Stay together.” She turned back to her work, hands raw, heart braced. The world outside was coming.

She pressed a fresh beam into place, half-prayer, half-defiance. “They always think sweetness is a trap,” she muttered, and the sugar trembled in her grip.

From the woods, the sound of voices—closer now.

A low, insectile whine sliced through the syrup-wet hush of the swamp. Greta froze at the kitchen island, paring a bruise from an apple with the steady hands of a surgeon. She didn’t look up, but the children did—Hansel’s knuckles whitening on the porch rail, Gretel’s socks already sugar-stained at the toes.

The drone hovered above the treeline, lens glinting, indifferent. Its shadow flickered over the mosaicked candy glass, over the syrup-glossed shingles, over Hansel & Gretel hesitating on the threshold. The house shimmered—a thing too sweet for this world, all marzipan trim and cola-bottle windows, beauty built from the refuse of old parties and the discipline of a chemist. Greta watched the children through the glass, heart hammering. She saw the calculation in their posture: run, or trust.

“Inside,” she hissed, voice shredded by urgency. The siblings exchanged a look—years of neglect in the pause—and stepped over the threshold. The door shut with a click, sealing in a velvet cloud of vanilla and engineered calm.

Online, the clip metastasized: children vanishing into a sugar palace, the porch light tinting their faces blood-red through cherry glass. The comments came faster than rot—witch, butcher, gingerbread crone—each one a stone thrown from the safety of anonymity. A news anchor’s voice, lacquered in cheer, looped the footage: “From above, the structure looks good enough to eat.”

Greta locked the deadbolt. “Take your shoes off,” she said, her voice too gentle, too practiced. Hansel’s eyes flicked to the lollipop banister, the licorice seams in the floor. “It smells like fairs, not like home,” he whispered, as if apology could make the memory of hunger vanish.

The drone’s whine faded, but a new sound rose—her phone vibrating on the counter, notifications stacking like stormclouds. Greta didn’t check. Outside, the syrup swamp glimmered with uncertain peace; inside, she knelt and dabbed Hansel’s scraped knee with sugar-paste, the antiseptic sweetness clinging to her fingers. She didn’t flinch when his tears pricked. “Sugar seals the wound,” she murmured. “Keeps the rot away.”

A gunmetal SUV idled at the edge of the swamp, headlights off. Greta saw it through the sugar-glass, saw the figures inside—parents or reporters or something worse. She reached for the emergency switch, thumb hovering, and told the children: “If anyone comes, you hide in the licorice room. Don’t open the door. Not for anyone but me.”

The phone vibrated again. “Gingerbread butcher,” the headline read. “Cannibal den in syrup swamp?”

Greta braced herself for siege. The next knock would not be gentle.

Greta heard them before she saw them—boots thrashing syrup-grass, the rattle of gunmetal shattering the Swamp’s lullaby. The children clustered behind her, sticky-fingered, eyes wide with an old, bone-deep fear. She pressed her palm to the licorice-vine door, feeling the tremor of their approach in the sweet-stiffened frame.

A voice, amplified and raw, cracked through the honeyed air: “This is your only warning! Send the kids out, witch!”

Greta’s hands—steady from decades of crisis—shook as she herded the siblings toward the hidden chamber, the pheromone mist thickening with their panic. “Inside. Quiet now. Remember the vanilla trick—just like we practiced.” She kissed the youngest’s syrup-crowned head, tasting the sharpness of terror beneath the sugar.

A flashlight’s beam sliced through the sugar-glass window. Greta glimpsed the mob: faces painted in blue glow, rifles haloed by peppermint porch lights, outrage curdling the air. One woman—eyes wild, cheeks sunken—brandished a phone like a spellbook, livestreaming the siege for a ravenous audience.

A rifle butt pounded the door, licorice vines quivering. Greta raised her voice, calm as caramel cooling: “These children are safe. You’ve been lied to. There’s no harm here—”

The door splintered, peppered with rainbow glass. A man shouldered through, nostrils flaring at the warm scent of burnt sugar and fear. His gun swept the room, then fixed on Greta—on her apron dusted with powdered vanilla, on the trembling tray of caramel twists she thrust out, absurdly, like a peace offering.

“Step away from the kids.” His finger tightened. “You think we don’t see what you are?”

Behind her, a child’s whisper: “Don’t let them follow the crumbs in.”

Greta stepped between the muzzle and the hidden door, heart thudding. “You see monsters because you’re afraid,” she said, voice low. “But fear can be sweetened, if you let it.”

Another crash—glass jars shattered, citrus sugar flooding the air. The militia blinked, momentarily stunned by the sudden rush of sweetness, confusion flickering in their eyes.

Outside, more shadows pressed in. Greta braced herself, body a barricade, knowing the next moment would decide everything. The Swamp, once a cradle, now a crucible. She tightened her grip on the tray, daring them to cross the threshold.

Somewhere deeper in the Swamp, sirens began to wail.

—End scene—

The children’s screams fractured the candied hush. Glassy panes of isomalt trembled as the front door buckled under another rifle butt. Syrupy light flickered across Greta’s hands—steady, then shaking—as she keyed the override buried in the licorice molding. She tasted copper. The panel’s display pulsed: *DEFENSE MODE—CONFIRM?* 

“They’re coming!” Anna’s voice, thin and tight, echoed from the spiral staircase. Behind her, the twins clung together, faces streaked with caramel tears.

Greta pressed her thumb to the sensor, breath ragged. “Eyes closed, darlings, just like we practiced.” Her voice snagged, frayed by memory—her own mother’s cold palm, the taste of cough syrup dripped between clenched teeth. Sweetness turned threat. She forced herself to smile, shielding the children with her body as the door splintered.

The first militia man staggered in, boots crunching peppermint shards, rifle swinging up. “She’s here! Cameras on!” His voice was giddy, hungry for proof. Behind him, the children’s parents lurched, wild-eyed, half-pleading, half-accusing: “Give them back, witch!”

Greta’s thumb lingered, then pressed. The walls convulsed. A slow, obscene slurp filled the air as amber syrup cascaded from ceiling cornices, pooling fast around ankles, then knees. The militia’s boots stuck fast; a woman shrieked, flailing, her phone lost to the viscous flood. The parents clawed for their children—“She’s feeding on us!”—but the syrup gripped them, dragging them down with the inexorable patience of grief.

Greta pulled the children close, syrup climbing her calves, sticky warmth seeping through her skin. “It’s only sugar,” she whispered, but the lie stung. The pheromone mist thickened, meant to soothe, now mingling with the sharp tang of panic. 

Outside, more fists pummeled the windows, faces distorted by refracted gold. Inside, the world slowed—gun barrels useless, voices muffled, fear trapped in amber. Greta watched her sanctuary dissolve, comfort weaponized, love curdled to necessity. The children’s eyes—wide, uncertain—searched her face: protector, witch, mother, monster.

Overhead, the emergency beacon flashed crimson through syruped glass. Greta’s hand hovered near the next switch—*LOCKDOWN: IRREVERSIBLE*. Outside, the mob’s roar grew. Inside, silence pressed sweet and suffocating.

She steeled herself. “Close your eyes,” she said, voice breaking. “We’re not done yet.”

A wall of black vests and riot shields sliced through the syrup mist—red dots jittered over caramel walls, rifles up, faces unreadable behind sticky-glossed visors. Greta blinked through the haze, arms instinctively spread, her body a trembling barricade between the cowering children and the invasion. The children clung to her skirt, their eyes wide, candy-crusted lips pressed tight to smother sobs. Somewhere behind the tactical line, the parents howled, waving kitchen knives and accusations, their voices raw with chemical rage.

“Hands where I can see them!” barked the SWAT leader, boots sinking with a slow, obscene squelch into the molasses floor. The room stank of burnt sugar and gun oil, the old comfort now soured, every sweet surface smeared with footprints and fear.

Greta raised her hands, palms sticky, voice cracking. “They’re just children! Please—let me explain—”

A laser sight skittered over her chest. “Step away from the minors, ma’am.” The officer’s voice wavered, the tremor lost in the syrup-thick air. On his shoulder, a body-cam’s red eye blinked, swallowing every movement for a hungry, unseen crowd.

Behind Greta, the oldest boy—the Hansel—palmed a shard of candy glass, knuckles white. He met her gaze: a question, a plea. Greta shook her head, barely perceptible. Not yet. Not violence.

The parents shrieked: “She’s poisoned them! She’s the witch—she drugged us all!” The words echoed, amplified by livestreams outside, each syllable fueling the legend.

A SWAT officer knelt, reaching for the smallest girl. She recoiled, pressing sticky hands to her face, whimpering. Greta fought the urge to run, to shield her, but the rifles twitched—her movement could make her monster or martyr in an instant.

“Let me show you,” Greta begged, voice low. “The candies—they calm, they heal. Test them. Please.”

The SWAT leader hesitated, a flicker of doubt behind his visor. Syrup dripped from the ceiling, spattering his glove, blurring the trigger beneath his finger. The room held its breath—one mistake from violence, one act from salvation.

A comm crackled: “Crowd breaching perimeter—militia’s coming in hot!”

Greta’s eyes darted to the shattered window, to the children’s terror, to the trembling rifles. Outside, the true wolves closed in. Inside, sweetness threatened to suffocate.

The SWAT leader’s voice broke the silence: “We need to decide—now. Who do we save?”

The answer hung, unspoken, as the world pressed closer—a question sharp as a candy shard, waiting to draw blood.

A rock ricochets off the candy-glazed archway—thwack, then the dull patter of sugar splinters raining onto the syrup-soaked moss. Greta doesn’t flinch. She keeps her hands steady, smoothing a patch of caramelized resin over a splintered window frame, ignoring the distant laughter from the road. Another tag—WITCH DEN—sprawls in acid-green across the sanctuary gate, letters dripping like venom.

Inside, Hansel’s voice cracks through the hush. “Gretel needs more strips,” he calls, clutching a glucose monitor, his hands trembling but sure. The girl beside him sits cross-legged on a licorice mat, her knees raw but healing. Greta wipes her palms on her apron, pushes through the peppermint-beaded curtain.

She kneels, her shadow blotting out the cartoonish sun painted by the children on the wall. “Hold still,” she murmurs. Her fingers are gentle, practiced—taping a glucose strip, tucking Gretel’s hair behind her ear. The girl winces but doesn’t pull away. Greta meets her gaze: “You’re safe here. That’s real.”

A phone buzzes—notification, news alert, meme gone viral again: Greta’s face, warped, teeth sharpened, the sanctuary’s sugar walls twisted into ghoulish shapes. Underneath: TOO SWEET TO BELIEVE. Her jaw tightens, but she silences the screen.

Hansel watches. “You could clear this up, you know. Take the interviews. Let them see.”

She shakes her head. “The only story that matters is the one we live.” She gestures to the garden outside, where Gretel’s planted bitter herbs among the mint. “Let the world have its monsters. We’ll grow something better.”

He nods, slow understanding dawning. “I’m staying,” he says, voice steady for the first time. “Rehab, therapy—the works. I want to get it right.”

Greta’s relief is brief, tinged with the knowledge of what waits beyond the barbed wire: more headlines, more jeers. Still, she rises, wipes caramel from her wrists, and moves to the door as the sun dips—custard-yellow gate glowing against the encroaching dusk.

A child’s laugh rings through the syrup air; in the distance, another rock clatters, another flash for a phone camera. Greta pauses, one hand on the battered teapot, waiting for its whistle. The sanctuary endures, sweet and scarred—a promise misunderstood but unbroken.

Outside, headlights flicker at the tree line. Greta squares her shoulders. The world is still hungry.

She opens the gate.
