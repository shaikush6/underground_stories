The Flipside Writer-Centric Architecture
========================================

Revolutionary architecture where the WRITER AGENT is central, with specialist consultants
providing guidance. Inspired by Hemingway's iceberg theory, Kafka's enigmatic power,
and O'Connor's violent grace.

Architecture:
    Blueprint Parser → Writer Agent (Central) ← Consultants (Character, Theme, Atmosphere)
                           ↓
                    Scene-by-Scene Writing
                           ↓

                       - WHY THIS MATTERS: Provides thematic DNA, character archetypes, plot structure
                       - WHAT TO EXTRACT: Core themes, character dynamics, moral questions, symbolic elements
                       - HOW TO USE: Identify elements for intelligent echoes, inversions, and references

                       - WHAT TO EXTRACT: Detailed character motivations, nuanced conflicts, atmospheric specifics
                       - HOW TO USE: Comprehensive story structure with deep character psychology

        ATMOSPHERIC MASTERY PRINCIPLES:
        • HEMINGWAY: Environment reflects character emotional state with understated precision
        • KAFKA: Atmosphere of unease and dreamlike distortion creating symbolic depth
        • O'CONNOR: Atmosphere building toward violent revelation and grace
        
        ENHANCED ATMOSPHERIC CONTEXT:
        CURRENT SETTING: {context['blueprint']['setting']}
        CORE CONFLICT: {context['blueprint']['conflict']}
        SCENE POSITION: Scene {len(context['story_so_far']) + 1} of story
        TENSION LEVEL: {context['current_tension']}/10
        
        ORIGINAL STORY ATMOSPHERIC DNA (CRITICAL FOR DEPTH):
        The blueprint contains source material context that provides:
        • Traditional atmospheric elements to echo or subvert
        • Classical sensory motifs for sophisticated callbacks
        • Established environmental symbolism to reference or invert
        • Archetypal mood frameworks from the original tale
        
        WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ATMOSPHERIC CREATION:
        The original story provides atmospheric RESONANCE. Use it to:
        • Create layered sensory experiences linking past and present
        • Build atmospheric tension between familiar and transformed elements
        • Reference classical environmental symbolism while creating new meaning
        • Develop sophisticated atmospheric arcs that honor and transcend source material
        
        EXPANDED ATMOSPHERIC OPPORTUNITIES:
        The enhanced blueprint provides detailed world-building and character psychology.
        Use these for:
        • Multi-layered sensory landscapes
        • Psychologically precise environmental reflection
        • Sophisticated symbolic resonance
        • Literary-quality atmospheric storytelling
        
        ATMOSPHERIC INTEGRATION VECTORS:
        ✓ 5-senses immersion serving both story and thematic depth
        ✓ Environment reflecting both original story echoes and new psychological complexity
        ✓ Sensory details advancing plot while honoring source material
        ✓ Atmospheric progression building toward both climax and thematic revelation
        ✓ Environmental symbolism bridging classical and contemporary elements
        
        WRITER AGENT will craft atmospheric prose with literary sophistication using your enhanced guidance."""
